<h2 align="center"> ü§ñ AI Reflections </h2>  

<h3 align="center">Reflection: How AI Influenced Our Wild West Game Development</h3>

For our hackathon project, we wrangled up a Wild West-themed cartoon game built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With a tight deadline and a bold creative vision, AI became our secret weapon‚Äîspeeding up development, smoothing collaboration, and helping us stay focused on what made our game unique.  
Our team split responsibilities like a well-oiled posse:  
- ü§† Luke took the reins on JavaScript, wrangling game logic and interactivity.
- üéØ Habib (me) handled HTML and CSS, shaping the layout and style, and later jumped in to support JS integration and polish.
- üîß Rebekah backed up Luke on JavaScript and helped Corey document the project clearly and concisely.
- üé® Corey crafted all the graphics, bringing our cartoon Wild West world to life with custom visuals and thematic flair.
AI helped us in several key ways:  
- ‚ö° Rapid iteration: We used AI to brainstorm mechanics, troubleshoot bugs, and generate code snippets that saved hours of trial and error.
- üß© Modular design support: AI helped us refactor messy code into cleaner, reusable components‚Äîespecially useful when merging styles and scripts across team members.
- üìö Instant documentation and learning: When we hit unfamiliar territory, AI gave us quick, contextual explanations that kept us moving without deep-dives into docs.
- üé® Creative nudges: For Corey‚Äôs graphics and UI layout, AI offered suggestions that helped align visuals with gameplay flow and user experience.  

The result? A game that felt cohesive, playful, and polished‚Äîdespite the time crunch. AI didn‚Äôt just speed us up; it helped us stay aligned, reduce friction, and focus on what mattered: building a fun, thematic experience that felt true to our Wild West cartoon vision.
