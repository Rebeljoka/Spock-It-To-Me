## ü§ñ AI Reflections

### Code Generation
> Copilot helped scaffold the initial game logic and DOM updates, saving time and sparking new ideas for how to structure the app.

### Debugging
> AI support flagged a missing event listener and helped resolve a logic bug in the win condition algorithm.

### Optimization
> Suggestions from Copilot led to cleaner code, better accessibility labels, and smoother UX transitions.

### Workflow Reflection
> Using AI tools made the development process more fluid and collaborative. It felt like having a second pair of eyes‚Äîespecially helpful during late-night coding sprints.
