<h3 align="center">Step 2: Background Image Creation</h3>

<h4 align="center">Step 2.1: Initial Generation</h4>

![Initial Generation](assets/documentation/background-creation-process/0initial-generation.PNG)  
<p align="center"><i>We asked Copilot(AI) to generate a specific scenary for the background of your site that would breath life into the theme we chose</i></p>  

<h4 align="center">Step 2.2: Title Implementation</h4>

<p align="center"><i>After receiving the image, we decided to remove the people and implement the title onto the saloon</i></p>  

<h4 align="center">Step 2.3: Refinement</h4>

<p align="center"><i>The final change we made to the image was Changing the font on the sign</i></p>  


<h3 align="center">Step 3: Button production</h3>


<h4 align="center">Step 3.1: Button generation</h4>

<p align="center"><i>We tasked Copilot(AI) with generating numerous images for the buttons that would fit into our Western theme</i></p>  


<h4 align="center">Step 3.2: Unclicked and Clicked Versions</h4>

<h2 align="center"> ü§ñ AI Reflections </h2>  

### Code Generation
> Copilot helped scaffold the initial game logic and DOM updates, saving time and sparking new ideas for how to structure the app.

### Debugging
> AI support flagged a missing event listener and helped resolve a logic bug in the win condition algorithm.

### Optimization
> Suggestions from Copilot led to cleaner code, better accessibility labels, and smoother UX transitions.

### Workflow Reflection
> Using AI tools made the development process more fluid and collaborative. It felt like having a second pair of eyes‚Äîespecially helpful during late-night coding sprints.
